# Home Applience ElectroShop - Full-Stack MERN E-Commerce App

This project is a complete e-commerce application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Material-UI.

It is divided into two separate projects:
1.  **`electromart-backend`**: A Node.js API whose **sole purpose** is to process and store customer orders.
2.  **`electromart-app`**: A React frontend that manages its own product catalog locally and only communicates with the backend during the final checkout.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm`)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (You can run it locally or use a free MongoDB Atlas cluster)

## How to Run

You must use **two separate terminal windows** to run this application, as the frontend and backend are independent servers.

---

### **Terminal 1: Run the Backend (API)**

1.  **Navigate to the backend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd electromart-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create your environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `electromart-backend` directory. Copy the following lines into it:

    ```
    # Set the port for the backend server
    PORT=5000

    # Add your MongoDB connection string
    # (Replace this with your own local or cloud MongoDB URI)
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/electroshop
    ```
    *Note: If using MongoDB Atlas, get your connection string from your cluster dashboard.*

4.  **Run the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your backend API will now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### **Terminal 2: Run the Frontend (React App)**

1.  **Open a new terminal window.**

2.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd electromart-app
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the frontend app:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Your React application will automatically open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Use

1.  Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2.  Browse the shop, add items to your cart, and view product details.
3.  Go to the cart page and proceed to checkout.
4.  Fill out the shipping form and click **"Place Order"**.
5.  This action will send the cart data to your running backend (`localhost:5000`), which will save it to your MongoDB database.
6.  You will be redirected to an order confirmation page, which will display the real **Order ID** (`_id`) generated by the database.
